     <h3>➤ The Purpose of this Web-App??</h3>
     <p>Why is it that some people eat mountains of food and still stay thin while others eat so little and still gain weight? Why is it that some people love the AC while others just can't tolerate the cold. Why does some people's skin break out after eating just two mangos while others eat anything and their skin still glows? Well these things are not random. According to ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, each of us has a unique body type. And it secretly controls almost everything about you. How you look, how you sleep, how you work and even the diseases you are most likely to face. Your body type was decided even before you were born. Right in your mother's womb, and it stays with you till the day you die. In this video, you will discover what your unique body type is through a fun quiz. And after that I will share with you how you can customize your food and lifestyle to suit your unique body type so you can live not just healthier but longer and with more joy than ever before.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>➤ What are these body types?</h3>
            <p>our ancient sciences share that everything in this universe is made up of the five great elements. Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. Weather it's a plant, a chair, your t-shirt, or even the phone that you're currently holding is all made of these five ingredients. But here's the fascinating part. These five elements are not just outside of you, they are also inside you. In your body all the solid structures, bonus, flush, skin are made of the earth element. All fluids, your saliva, urine, blood, sweat are the water element. The heat that keeps you warm, that transforms your food into smaller molecules, that's the fire element. The life-giving breath that you're inhaling and gulping, even right now, that's the air element. And the various empty spaces in your body, in your arteries, in your intestines, in your nasal passages, that's the space element. You have all five elements inside you. That's what your physical body is made of. But these five elements are all in equal proportion, well, no. In each person their balance is different.  This difference creates the 3 doshas.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>➤ The 3 doshas: Vata, Pitta, Kapha.</h3>
          
            <h4>Vata Body Type</h4>
            <p>When the air and space elements dominate in someone's body, they're called a vata body type. Vata people are just like the wind, fast moving both in their body and thoughts.</p>
                        <h4>Pitta Body Type</h4>
            <p>When fire and water elements dominate, they are called the Pitta body type. Pitta people are just like the fire, piercing, hot, intense, passionate and can even get angry easily. </p>
                        <h4>Kapha Body Type</h4>
            <p>When water and earth dominate, they are called a Kapha body type. Kapha people adjust like the earth, stable, heavy, grounded and calm. Both physically and emotionally.</p>
            <h5>This unique mix of elements within you is called your body type, or your nature.</h5>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>➤ Can one Have a combination of different doshas?</h3>
            <p>YES. Once can have a mix of these 3 doashas, however in general, there is one primary dosha and there is one secondary doashas.
                <br> The primary dosha has the strongest impact on your nature. hr

            <h3>➤ Which is the best body type?</h3>
           <p>
            Would it make sense if a rose wished it smelled like a jasmine flower?
            <br>

            Or if a magnificent elephant who wished he was lean like a giraffe?<br> It would be utterly ridiculous. Right? But this is exactly what we do every single day. She has a really thin body. Why don't we do? She has really big eyes and lusty hair. Why don't I?<br> We forget that Mother Nature has blessed us with each
           
            With a special blueprint. Which is perfect and so beautiful in its own way. <br> The moment we stop comparing and start embracing it. That is where true joy begins.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #0077b6; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Vata Dosha</h2>

    <h4 style="color: #005f73; margin-top: 20px;">Strengths</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Vata is the energy of wind and space and just like the wind you are full of movement, lightness and change.</li>
      <li>Just like the wind cools wherever it lands on and rises wherever it touches similarly your nature too is cool and dry.</li>
      <li>Your body being light is also very quick and agile.</li>
      <li>You move fast, you speak fast. Sometimes even faster than the world can keep up. And it's not just your body, your mind also. Things happen fast. That's why it's so easy for you to learn something very quickly.</li>
      <li>You can shift from one idea to the next. Effortlessly. Which makes you quite able. You can thrive in new environments, new roles, new situations. Among all the three body types.</li>
      <li>Vatas are also the most drawn toward higher states of awareness, to spirituality, philosophy, and deep introspection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #005f73; margin-top: 20px;">Weaknesses</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>You easily feel cold, and your skin gets dry if you don't take care of it.</li>
      <li>Sometimes mentally agile for others to understand you.</li>
      <li>Money—you don't usually hold on. You love spending it as fast as you earn it.</li>
      <li>Physically, you may become overly thin, struggling to gain weight.</li>
      <li>No matter what you do, mentally your mind can start racing too much—hopping from one thought to the other. Erratic, indecisive, changing quickly. You may become fizzy, even restless, unable to sit still.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #005f73; margin-top: 20px;">Does</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>To keep your Vata in control, you need elements opposite of yours, which are Water and Earth—and these are grounding and nourishing.</li>
      <li>Your best friend is <strong>snehana</strong>, which means oiling both inside and outside.
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>Outside, by regularly oiling yourself through self-massage.</li>
          <li>Inside, by eating foods which naturally have more oil in them—like nuts and fats.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>And you need food that is grounding, lubricating, and slightly intense and heavy.
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>Vegetables like pumpkin, sweet potatoes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Yoga is the best recreation for you—slow and steady exercises.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #005f73; margin-top: 20px;">Donts</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>If you only eat light salads and dry snacks, it will only aggravate your weight further.</li>
      <li>When it comes to movement, avoid super intense cardio. Instead, choose yoga and slow strength-training practices that help you build.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

            <div class="pitta" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; background-color: #fff7f0; border: 2px solid #f5c49c; border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); color: #4b2e1e;">
    <h2 style="color: #d35400; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Pitta Dosha</h2>

    <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 20px;">Strengths</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>The fire cracker, the go getter, the born leader.</li>
      <li>Just like fire, you are intensely hot. And almost impossible to ignore.</li>
      <li>The planner, the achiever, the one who doesn't just dream but who transforms those dreams into reality.</li>
      <li>You try to have structure, you love to do lists, deadlines. You love to lead.</li>
      <li>And good enough. That's not in your dictionary. You chase perfection. Sometimes a little too hard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 20px;">Weaknesses</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>You must control your fire, which if not balanced:
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>Physically you may start feeling acidity, rashes, acne on your skin, even have high blood pressure.</li>
          <li>Mentally you may find yourself snapping at people in anger, losing patience over small things, wanting to control and dominate everyone around you—even your inner voice becomes harsh, overly critical of yourself and others.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 20px;">Does</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Your best friend is the cool—to keep the inner fire in check.</li>
      <li>You need to load up on foods and drinks that are cooling and hydrating in nature.
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>Like melons, apples, beets, coconut, cherries.</li>
          <li>Like cooling vegetables such as cucumbers, ash gourd, ridge gourd.</li>
          <li>Sip on coconut water.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>And if you want to have teas, make them cooling—herbs like mint, fennel, rose petals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #c0392b; margin-top: 20px;">Donts</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Ironically, what you will crave the most will be spicy food—with lots of masala—which will completely put your Pitta out of balance.
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>No spicy curries, spicy masalas, oily foods, pickles.</li>
          <li>Too many nuts, which are oily in nature—you should reduce as far as possible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

            <div class="kapha" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto; background-color: beige; border: 2px solid #b2d8b2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); color: #2e4d1f;">
    <h2 style="color: #38761d; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Kapha Dosha</h2>

    <h4 style="color: #2d6a4f; margin-top: 20px;">Strengths</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>You are like the earth — stable, calm, deeply grounded.</li>
      <li>Physically, you are likely to have a strong, well-built frame, expressive features, thick lashes, lustrous hair.</li>
      <li>You radiate a certain softness — a warmth which makes people around you feel very safe.</li>
      <li>You might think a lot before starting something new. But when you commit, you go all in. And you make sure it's done.</li>
      <li>Doing things slightly slow — but very surely — is actually a superpower. In a world that's always racing, you rarely make impulsive decisions. You really think everything through.</li>
      <li>You have the memory of an elephant. Once you learn something, you remember it for a long time — unlike a person who learns fast and forgets fast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #2d6a4f; margin-top: 20px;">Weaknesses</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>If your Kapha increases too much, you gain weight too fast.</li>
      <li>Your digestion becomes slow and sluggish.</li>
      <li>And after meals, you feel like sinking into a comfortable sofa.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #2d6a4f; margin-top: 20px;">Does</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>The most important advice for you: don't get stuck in stillness — neither physically nor mentally. Movement is your best medicine.</li>
      <li>Do really heavy exercises.</li>
      <li>Eat fruits like pineapple, papaya, apples, oranges, berries.</li>
      <li>Consume water-rich vegetables like bottle gourd, ridge gourd, zucchini over sweet dense ones.</li>
      <li>Unlike for Pittas, spices are actually good for you — they help cut Kapha. So you can generally use spices like ginger, black pepper, turmeric, mustard seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, green chillies, and pepper in your meals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #2d6a4f; margin-top: 20px;">Donts</h4>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li>Simple stretches will not cut it for you. You need intensity. You need to squat, run, jump, dance, sprint — whatever gets your heart pumping faster. Among all the body types, you need activity the most.</li>
      <li>Also, you will be the most drawn to heavy dense comfort foods — chocolates, pastries, nuts, butter, cheese, rich grain-based dishes. But those are your worst enemies.</li>
    </ul>
