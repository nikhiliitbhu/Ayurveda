     <h3>➤ The Purpose of this Web-App??</h3>
     <p>Why is it that some people eat mountains of food and still stay thin while others eat so little and still gain weight? Why is it that some people love the AC while others just can't tolerate the cold. Why does some people's skin break out after eating just two mangos while others eat anything and their skin still glows? Well these things are not random. According to ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, each of us has a unique body type. And it secretly controls almost everything about you. How you look, how you sleep, how you work and even the diseases you are most likely to face. Your body type was decided even before you were born. Right in your mother's womb, and it stays with you till the day you die. In this video, you will discover what your unique body type is through a fun quiz. And after that I will share with you how you can customize your food and lifestyle to suit your unique body type so you can live not just healthier but longer and with more joy than ever before.</p>

            <h3>➤ What are these body types?</h3>
            <p>our ancient sciences share that everything in this universe is made up of the five great elements. Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. Weather it's a plant, a chair, your t-shirt, or even the phone that you're currently holding is all made of these five ingredients. But here's the fascinating part. These five elements are not just outside of you, they are also inside you. In your body all the solid structures, bonus, flush, skin are made of the earth element. All fluids, your saliva, urine, blood, sweat are the water element. The heat that keeps you warm, that transforms your food into smaller molecules, that's the fire element. The life-giving breath that you're inhaling and gulping, even right now, that's the air element. And the various empty spaces in your body, in your arteries, in your intestines, in your nasal passages, that's the space element. You have all five elements inside you. That's what your physical body is made of. But these five elements are all in equal proportion, well, no. In each person their balance is different.  This difference creates the 3 doshas.</p>

            <h3>➤ The 3 doshas: Vata, Pitta, Kapha.</h3>
          
            <h4>Vata Body Type</h4>
            <p>When the air and space elements dominate in someone's body, they're called a vata body type. Vata people are just like the wind, fast moving both in their body and thoughts.</p>
                        <h4>Pitta Body Type</h4>
            <p>When fire and water elements dominate, they are called the Pitta body type. Pitta people are just like the fire, piercing, hot, intense, passionate and can even get angry easily. </p>
                        <h4>Kapha Body Type</h4>
            <p>When water and earth dominate, they are called a Kapha body type. Kapha people adjust like the earth, stable, heavy, grounded and calm. Both physically and emotionally.</p>
            <h5>This unique mix of elements within you is called your body type, or your nature.</h5>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>➤ Can one Have a combination of different doshas?</h3>
            <p>YES. Once can have a mix of these 3 doashas, however in general, there is one primary dosha and there is one secondary doashas.
                <br> The primary dosha has the strongest impact on your nature. hr

            <h3>➤ Which is the best body type?</h3>
           <p>
            Would it make sense if a rose wished it smelled like a jasmine flower?
            <br>

            Or if a magnificent elephant who wished he was lean like a giraffe?<br> It would be utterly ridiculous. Right? But this is exactly what we do every single day. She has a really thin body. Why don't we do? She has really big eyes and lusty hair. Why don't I?<br> We forget that Mother Nature has blessed us with each
           
            With a special blueprint. Which is perfect and so beautiful in its own way. <br> The moment we stop comparing and start embracing it. That is where true joy begins.</p>
